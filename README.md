  TECHNOLOGIES USED: HTML,CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT
  
I learned how to use css animations on buttons.I learned how to create classes and class id's.I learned how to use switch statements instead of if or else if.I learned how to randomly select items out of an array. It was a challenge at first getting the previous user choices on the screen on click. I also was able to update the score and display it to the user.
